It uses Java's latest built-in hashing algorithms and is independent of any other libraries.\r\n\r\n#### Output format\r\n\r\nAll passwords are salted and hashed by selecting a desired hash algorithm. The secure salted and hashed passwords are generated in the below format to be used in the applications as desired:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalgorithm:salt:hash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first section is the name of the algorithm in plaintext. Second section is the salt value encoded in Based64 and third section is the hashed value of the raw password and salt combined then encoded in Base64. The separator character is a ':' (colon character). Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreak-down of above line:  \r\nAlgorithm: ```SHA512```  \r\nSalt (Base64): ```nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==```  \r\nHash (Base64): ```H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==```  \r\n\r\n#### How to\r\n\r\nSimply pass the raw password (in plaintext) to the ```createPassword()``` method with a desired hash algorithm:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString result = PasswordUtils.createPassword(rawPassword, HashAlgorithm.SHA512);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor faster and easier usage, no algorithm is required to be passed and a default (SHA-256) hash algorithm will be used:\r\n  \r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString result = PasswordUtils.createPassword(rawPassword);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result string will contain a properly formatted password hash:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nSHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo verify a raw password (in plaintext) with a hashed password (with the same format created using this class) simply use ```verifyPassword()``` method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString alreadyHashedPassword = \"SHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\";\r\nboolean result = PasswordUtils.verifyPassword(rawPassword, alreadyHashedPassword);\r\n```\r\n",
