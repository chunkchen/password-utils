It uses Java's latest build-in hashing algorithms and is independent of any other libraries.\r\n\r\n#### Output format\r\n\r\nAll the passwords are salted and hashed by selecting a desired hash algorithm. The secure salted and hashed passwords are generated in the below format to be used in the applications as desired:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalgorithm:salt:hash\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first part is the name of the algorithm, second section is the salt value and third section is the hashed value of the raw password and salt  combined. The separator character is a ':' (colon character). The salt and hash are Base64 encoded at the end when generating the final hash string.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How to\r\n\r\nSimply provide the raw password to the createPassword() function and select a desired hash algorithm:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString result = PasswordUtils.createPassword(rawPassword, HashAlgorithm.SHA512);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor faster and easier usage, no algorithm needed to be supplied and a default (SHA-256) hash algorithm will be used:\r\n  \r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString result = PasswordUtils.createPassword(rawPassword);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result string will contain a properly formatted password hash:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nSHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo verify a raw password with a hashed password (with the same format created in this class):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString rawPassword = \"badPassword1234\";\r\nString alreadyHashedPassword = \"SHA512:nkQfEBbs7FwwcADCq5UGtg==:H/Bg9EQfNXrPybVLXBg9MNx1hB2VHM9db5Fwzvlx3i1k53lOEJM9eTofCkMBddQEzRd9sNDCACZZsflh42IyCw==\";\r\nboolean isEqual = PasswordUtils.verifyPassword(rawPassword, alreadyHashedPassword);\r\n```\r\n",
